# Secur-What
Secur-What ?! Learning cyber security from mistakes

I wrote a book!

It's available on Amazon. ==> https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09X47TN5Q

It's called "Secur-WHAT?! Learning security from mistakes". It contains dozens of short anecdotes along with real-life lessons. It's rather general and not too technical. It could be seen as an introduction to security or as a reminder of basic security principles.
